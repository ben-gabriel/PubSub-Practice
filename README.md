# PubSub-Practice
This is a repository to hold the code for the Pub/Sub design pattern practice.
The Pub/Sub design pattern proposes a workflow in which the different components 
of a program, can work isolated from one another but interact with the rest by 
"subscribing" and "publishing" events.
This project started with the idea of practicing the Pub/Sub design pattern, but 
I also ended up practicing and learning CSS as well.
